    "text": "About this blog\nHi, I’m Liu Yanci, a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at Tsinghua University. My research primarily focuses on how emotions influence individual time perception. I am deeply interested in understanding the underlying psychological mechanisms that shape how we experience and process time in different emotional states.\nThrough this website, I hope to share my research, ideas, and projects, and to engage with fellow researchers and professionals who are interested in similar topics. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss my work or collaborate on related research!\nEmail address: yancicandice@gmail.com"
